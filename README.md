A small dominating set verifier for [PACE 2025](https://pacechallenge.org/2025/).
This verifier is available as a Java/Maven project. We recommend IntelliJ to build the project.
The program expects two arguments: the first argument is a path to the `.gr`-file containing your graph and the second argument is a path to the solution file. 
Follow [this link](https://pacechallenge.org/2025/ds/) for more information on the input/output files.
